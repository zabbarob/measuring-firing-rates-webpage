        <h1>Measuring Firing Rates<br><small>by Robert Costa, 2013 October 13</small></h1>
        <p class="muted" style="line-height:1em;"><small>All methods demonstrated on this web page are based on section <i>1.2 Spike Trains and Firing Rates</i> of <i>Dayan, P., Abbott, L. F., &amp; Abbott, L. (2001). Theoretical neuroscience: Computational and mathematical modeling of neural systems</i>.</small></p>
        <p><b>Neurons</b> communicate with each other by firing so-called
          <b><abbr title="an electrochemical potential">action potentials</abbr></b>.
          A single action potential usually has a
          duration of roughly one millisecond. If we ignore its
          duration, amplitude and shape, we can treat an action potential as
          a stereotypical on-off event, where a single action potential firing
          is called a spike. A sequence of spikes recorded over a single
          <abbr title="usually a time span of several seconds">trial</abbr> is
          called a <b>spike train</b>. If we record multiple trials we can
          average the number of spikes fired at a specific time point over
          these trials. The resulting value is the <b>firing rate</b> of the
          neuron at a specific time point. Since we can only record a limited
          number of trials the real firing rate can only be approximated but
          not determined exactly. In the following we will look at different methods to approximate firing rates. For demonstration purposes only a single spike train will be used. By averaging over multiple trials before applying any of the discussed methods, more accurate results can be achieved.</p>
